🎉 Exciting News: Just Launched My Latest React.js E-Commerce Project! 🛒

I’m thrilled to share my newly built, fully responsive e-commerce website developed with React.js! This project was an incredible journey into creating a seamless, interactive, and user-friendly online shopping experience.

✨ Here’s what’s under the hood:
📄 Multi-Page Navigation:
✔️ Homepage – Dynamically renders products on load.
✔️ Collection Page – Browse all items with advanced filtering.
✔️ About Page – Learn more about the brand.
✔️ Contact Page – Easy reach-out for queries.


🛍️ Product & Cart Features:
🔹 Product Detail Page – Click any product to view:
High-quality image
Title & Price
Quantity selector
Size selection
Detailed description & customer reviews
"Add to Cart" button


🔹 Smart Collection Page – Filter products by:
Categories: Women | Men | Kids 👗👕🧥
Types: Topwear | Bottomwear | Winterwear
Search Bar – Find items by title instantly!
🛒 Advanced Cart Functionality:
➕ Add items with image, title, quantity, and size.
❌ Delete items easily with a click.
🧮 Live Cart Calculation – Updates totals in real-time when adding/increasing quantities.
📌 Smart Notifications:
- ✅ "Item added to cart" – on successful addition.
- ⚠️ "Select item size" – if size is not chosen.
- 📭 "Your cart is empty" – when no items are present.


⚡ Why This Project Stands Out:
Built with modular, reusable React components.
State managed efficiently for cart, filters, and user interactions.
Fully responsive across all devices.
Clean UI with focus on intuitive user experience.
This project really pushed me in mastering React state management, dynamic routing, conditional rendering, and responsive design. It’s not just a website—it’s a functional, interactive e-commerce platform ready to scale!
🔧 Tech Stack: React.js | CSS | JavaScript | React Router | Context API (State Management)
